================

TLDR: Purely academic, Flex and Bison based, Java (subset) to llvm compiler

This project was made for the 2013-2014 Compilers class for the Bachelors in Computer Engineering at the University of Coimbra.

It's unfinished and doesn't include llvm code generation but this is all I had time to do considering the circunstances. Hopefully it will inspire someone. Plenty of dirty hacks abound due to restrictions of the evaluation method.

Most of the documentation for the course is in Portuguese but the entirety of the code is in English. My own report will be included at a later date in github markdown (and might be translated into English).
